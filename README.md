# Detect-Russian-Road-Signs
### Version 
#### 0.1.0
###  Description 
Coursework on Python programming language version 3.x was completed by a first-year student of the Information Systems and Technologies Faculty at Nizhny Novgorod State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering (IS-35 group).

As part of the project, a convolutional neural network was developed based on pre-trained weights and biases from the well-known YOLOv8 model. The neural network's purpose was to recognize traffic signs in Russia. The network was trained on a dataset previously created in-house using the Roboflow service, which provides a REST API for workspace management. To obtain a training sample, the student registered with the service and obtained an API key with a unique code. The API key was assigned to the student environment variable to prevent unauthorized access by other users.
